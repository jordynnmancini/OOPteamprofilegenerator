# Team-Profile-Generator-Using-OOP

## Description
The goal of this project is to use node.js and the inquirer npm package to prompt the user to build a profile for their team of software engineers. The final result is a well organized HTML page (and a CSS styling sheet) that is generated dynamically from the user's inputs into the command line after running `node index.js`.
