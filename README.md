# Team-Profile-Generator-Using-OOP

## Description
The goal of this project is to use node.js and the inquirer npm package to prompt the user to build a profile for their team of software engineers. The final result is a well organized HTML page (and a CSS styling sheet) that is generated dynamically from the user's inputs into the command line after running `node index.js`.

## Installation
Run `npm i` to install dependencies - inquirer & jest. 

## Tests
Use `npm run test` in the command line to run the tests. Tests can be found in the `_tests_/` folder. However, I had a problem with the tests - specifically, getting jest to run on my computer. I included a demo of the problem below.

## Usage 
This project requires you to download `node.js` onto your local machine. You will also need to use the `npm inquirer` package & `npm jest` for testing.
